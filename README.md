# TimeMasters Puzzle  
is a captivating puzzle game designed to challenge users logic skills,
built using the MVVM+Router architecture to ensure a clean,
scalable, and maintainable codebase.
## Architecture
We adopted the MVVM+Router pattern for this project. 
This allows for a clear separation of concerns between the user interface and business logic,
making the app scalable and easier to maintain. Here's a brief overview:

Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) ensures that each View has a corresponding ViewModel to handle logic and data binding.
Router helps to manage transitions and navigation between screens in a decoupled and modular way.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and run the following commands:
pod install

Then, open the .xcworkspace file to work with the project.

## App Store
TimeMasters is proudly available on the App Store.
